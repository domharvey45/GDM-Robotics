## Setup

### Initialisation

To initialise the code on your local system:

1. install [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. make sure the path to your nodejs folder is added to [PATH](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)
3. install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
4. run `git clone https://github.com/domharvey45/GDM-Robotics.git`
5. run `cd GDM-Robotics`
6. run `npm install`

### VSCode Plugins

#### [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)

This plugin attempts to override user/workspace settings with settings found in .editorconfig files. No additional or vscode-specific files are required.

#### [Markdown All In One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)

All you need for Markdown (keyboard shortcuts, table of contents, auto preview and more).

#### [Markdown Preview Github Styling](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles)

Changes VS Code's built-in markdown preview to match GitHub's styling.

#### [Arduino](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-arduino)

The Arduino extension makes it easy to develop, build, and deploy your Arduino sketches in Visual Studio Code, with a rich set of functionalities. These include:

1. IntelliSense and syntax highlighting for Arduino sketches
2. Verify and upload your sketches in Visual Studio Code
3. Built-in board and library manager
4. Built-in example list
5. Built-in serial monitor
6. Snippets for sketches
7. Automatic Arduino project scaffolding
8. Command Palette (F1) integration of frequently used commands (e.g. Verify, Upload...)

#### [Clang-Format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xaver.clang-format)

This extension allows clang-format (version 3.8 or higher) to be used to format C/C++, Javascript etc. source files directly from within Visual Studio Code.

Files can be formatted on-demand by right clicking in the document and selecting "Format Document", or by using the associated keyboard shortcut (usually Ctrl+⇧+F on Windows, Ctrl+⇧+I on Linux, and ⇧+⌥+F on macOS).
